# MotorMetrics Database - Developer Reference Guide

## Schema Change Workflow

Modify schema files in `src/schema/`, then `pnpm push` to apply them to the
**development** Neon branch and iterate there. Once the shape has settled, `pnpm
generate` and review the generated SQL in `migrations/`. Commit it — staging and
production apply it on deploy, since `vercel-build` runs `db:migrate`. Types update
automatically via Drizzle inference; never hand-edit generated migrations.

**Do not run `pnpm migrate` against development.** `push` has already applied those
changes, but without recording a row in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`, so `migrate`
sees the new migration as pending and replays SQL against a schema that already has
it — `ADD COLUMN` then fails as already-exists. The development ledger drifts from the
repo by design and should never be "repaired" to match. To rehearse a migration, point
`DATABASE_URL` at a fresh Neon branch of production and run `pnpm migrate` plus
`pnpm migrate:check` there.

## Entry Points

There is no package barrel. `package.json` exposes two subpaths:

- `@motormetrics/database/client` — the `db` instance. Importing it opens a Neon
  connection at module load, so only import it where a query actually runs.
- `@motormetrics/database/schema` — tables and their `Insert*`/`Select*` types.

`src/schema/index.ts` is deliberately kept as a barrel: `drizzle.config.ts` points its
`schema` option at that one file, and `src/relations.ts` needs `import * as schema` to
build the relations config. It re-exports table definitions only, with no side effects.

Drizzle operators (`eq`, `and`, `sql`, …) come from `drizzle-orm` directly. Consumers
already depend on it, so re-exporting them here only obscured where they came from.

## Naming Conventions

**Table names**: `snake_case` (e.g., `cars`, `coe`, `pqp`)
**Column names**: `camelCase` (e.g., `vehicleClass`, `biddingNo`, `fuelType`) — this is
deliberate and differs from the usual Drizzle/Postgres `snake_case` default.
**Indexes**: Auto-generated names (no explicit naming required)

## Domain Vocabulary

**Month format**: all `month` columns are text in `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., `"2024-01"`).
`vehicle_population.year` is text in `YYYY` format. They are text, not dates, because
the upstream LTA DataMall feeds publish them that way.

**COE categories** (`coe.vehicleClass`, `pqp.vehicleClass`):

- **A**: Cars up to 1600cc & 130bhp
- **B**: Cars above 1600cc or 130bhp
- **C**: Goods vehicles & buses
- **D**: Motorcycles
- **E**: Open category

`coe.biddingNo` is the bidding exercise within the month — 1 or 2 (two exercises run
each month).

**VQS categories** (`deregistrations.category`) use the full label form, not the COE
letter form: `"Category A"`, `"Category B"`, `"Category C"`, `"Category D"`,
`"Vehicles Exempted From VQS"`, `"Taxis"`.

**PQP table rename**: the `pqp` table was formerly named `coe_pqp`. Older migrations and
any external references may still use the old name.

**Posts uniqueness**: `posts` has a compound unique constraint on `month` + `dataType`
("cars" or "coe"). This is what makes AI blog generation idempotent — re-running a
generation for a month upserts the existing post instead of creating a duplicate.
`slug` is separately unique for URL routing.

## Environment Configuration

The package uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for PostgreSQL connection:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
```

## Performance

Add indexes based on actual query patterns rather than speculatively; monitor slow
queries and adjust the schema accordingly. Consider partitioning for large historical
datasets.
