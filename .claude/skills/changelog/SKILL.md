# Changelog Skill

Changelogs are auto-generated by `@semantic-release/changelog` on each release.

## How It Works

1. semantic-release runs on push to `main`
2. `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` generates notes from commits (conventionalcommits preset)
3. `@semantic-release/changelog` prepends notes to `CHANGELOG.md`
4. `@semantic-release/git` commits the updated changelog

## Changelog Sections

Commit types map to changelog sections:

| Commit Type | Changelog Section |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `feat` | Features |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes |
| `perf` | Performance Improvements |
| `revert` | Reverts |
| `feat!` / `BREAKING CHANGE` | BREAKING CHANGES |

Types `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci` do **not** appear in the changelog.

## Viewing Changelog

```bash
# View the changelog file
cat CHANGELOG.md

# View a specific GitHub release's notes
gh release view v4.46.0

# List recent releases with dates
gh release list --limit 10
```

## Missing Changelog Entry?

If a commit does not appear in the changelog:
1. Check the commit type — only `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert` generate entries
2. Verify the commit landed on `main` (not a feature branch)
3. Check if semantic-release ran: `gh run list --workflow=release.yml`
4. Ensure commit message follows conventional format

## File Location

- **Changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` (root of repository)
- **Config**: `.releaserc.json` → `@semantic-release/changelog` plugin
