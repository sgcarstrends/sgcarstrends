              Certificate of Entitlement (COE) Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP)
              rates are specific to Singapore&apos;s vehicle ownership system.
              They represent the average COE prices over the last 3 months,
              which car owners must pay to renew their existing vehicle&apos;s
              COE.
            </p>
            <p>
              The PQP system allows car owners to extend their COE for another 5
              or 10 years by paying the prevailing market rate rather than
              bidding in the open market. This is particularly relevant for
              owners who wish to keep their vehicles beyond the initial 10-year
              COE period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Land Transport Authority (LTA) calculates and updates these
              rates monthly based on the moving average of COE prices in the
              preceding three months.
