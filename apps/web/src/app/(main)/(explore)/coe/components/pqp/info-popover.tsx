                Certificate of Entitlement (COE) Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP)
                rates are specific to Singapore&apos;s vehicle ownership system.
                They represent the average COE prices over the last 3 months,
                which car owners must pay to renew their existing vehicle&apos;s
                COE.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PQP system allows car owners to extend their COE for another
                5 or 10 years by paying the prevailing market rate rather than
                bidding in the open market. This is particularly relevant for
                owners who wish to keep their vehicles beyond the initial
                10-year COE period.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Land Transport Authority (LTA) calculates and updates these
                rates monthly based on the moving average of COE prices in the
                preceding three months.
