# PostHog post-wizard report

The wizard has completed a deep integration of PostHog analytics into the MotorMetrics web application. Client-side tracking is initialised via `instrumentation-client.ts` (Next.js 15.3+ pattern) with a reverse proxy through `/ingest` to avoid tracking blockers. Server-side events are captured via `posthog-node` in the API routes. User identification is wired up on admin login so that frontend and backend events are correlated against the same distinct ID.

### Agent skill

We've left an agent skill folder in your project at `.claude/skills/integration-nextjs-app-router/`. You can use this context for further agent development when using Claude Code. This will help ensure the model provides the most up-to-date approaches for integrating PostHog.
